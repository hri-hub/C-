(POINTERS)
//& is used to fetch the address of the value stored in a variable
//*var, here * is just used to denote pointers....when * is used the cursor is pointed to the value of the address and when printed it gives the value of the variable
//p=&a stores address of a to p
Program to find the quotient and remainder of two variables using pointers

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a,b;
    cin>>a>>b;
    int *pa=&a; // here value of a is printed when cout<<*pa
    int *pb=&b; // here value of b is printed when cout<<*pb
    cout<<*pa / *pb<<" "<<*pa % *pb;
}
